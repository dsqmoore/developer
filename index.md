# Welcome

Welcome to the CloudApp developer docs. Here you can find everything you need to integrate your application with CloudApp.

## Getting Started

There is a good chance most of the work is already cut out for you. A variety of third-party client libraries are available to interface with the CloudApp REST API. We recommend checking out the available API wrappers.

## Real World Examples

Great applications are already using the CloudApp API. Here are some popular examples:

{: .index}
* [Cloud2go](http://cloud2goapp.com/) -- a powerful iPhone client to access CloudApp on the go
* [Cloudette](http://cloudetteapp.com/) -- a free CloudApp iPhone client
* [Doxie](http://www.getdoxie.com/) -- scan directly into the cloud
* [Weet](http://weetapp.com/) -- a Twitter client with CloudApp integration

## Getting Help

The CloudApp API follows standard REST guidelines and implementation should be pretty straight forward. Should you have questions we recommend:

* [Asking your question](http://stackoverflow.com/) on Stackoverflow (experienced developers will be able to help)
* [Browsing through the developer discussions](http://support.getcloudapp.com/discussions/developersapi/) in our support forum
