# Welcome

Welcome to the CloudApp developer docs. Here you can find everything you need to integrate your application with CloudApp.

## Getting Started

There is a good chance most of the work is already cut out for you. A variety of third-party client libraries are available to interface with the CloudApp REST API. We recommend checking out the available API wrappers.

## Real World Examples

Great applications are already using the CloudApp API. Here are some popular examples:
