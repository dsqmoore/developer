# Usage

You can use the CloudApp API to [register an account](/register/), [list your items](/list-items/), [upload a file](/upload-file/) -- anything [Cloud.app](http://getcloudapp.com/download/) or the [web app](http://my.cl.ly/) can do.

## Authentication

[HTTP Digest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication/) is used to authenticate all requests.

## JSON

You're probably interested in JSON responses and not HTML. Add the header `Accept: application/json` on requests to receive JSON and `Content-Type: application/json` when you're sending JSON.

Keep in mind usage of the CloudApp API is bound to our [Terms Of Service](http://getcloudapp.com/terms/).
