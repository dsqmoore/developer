# Stream Items

Connect to a socket and listen as items for an account are created, updated, and
deleted in real time. That's right. No more polling the
[list items API][list-items] looking for changes!

We use [Pusher] for websocket support. Grab an
[open source API library][pusher-libs] in the langage of your choice and follow
along. The examples below make use of their JavaScript client to connect to a
socket and listen for events on a channel.


## Gather Socket Details

The first step is to gather some details about the socket in order to connect.
These details are available via the [view account details] endpoint. Here's an
excerpt:

    {
      "socket": {
        "auth_url": "http://my.cloudapp.local/pusher/auth",
        "api_key":  "36b8e92a50487f79cbb3",
        "app_id":   "4072",
        "channels": {
          "items": "private-items_1"
        }
      }
    }


## Configure Pusher

Next, pass this data along to Pusher and subscribe to the channel. Assuming the
response from the above API call was stored in the variable named `account`,
it would look something like:

    // Use JSONP because it's a cross-domain request.
    Pusher.channel_auth_transport = 'jsonp';
    Pusher.channel_auth_endpoint  = account.socket.auth_url;


## Configure Pusher

Now for the fun part! Subscribe to the items channel and listen for one of more
of the events `"create"`, `"update"`, or `"delete"` which will be dispatched as
items are, you guessed it, created, updated, or deleted.

    var itemsChannel = new Pusher(account.socket.api_key)
                             .subscribe(account.socket.channels.items)

    itemsChannel.bind('create', function(data) { });
    itemsChannel.bind('update', function(data) { });
    itemsChannel.bind('delete', function(data) { });

The `data` passed to the above callback handlers is idential to the
[list items API][list-items].

    {
      "href":         "http://my.cl.ly/items/1912565",
      "name":         "CloudApp",
      "private":      true,
